Type 1 diabetes was previously called insulin-dependent diabetes or juvenile diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs when some or all of the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are destroyed. This leaves the patient with little or no insulin. Without insulin, sugar accumulates in the bloodstream rather than entering the cells. As a result, the body cannot use this glucose for energy. In addition, the high levels of glucose that remain in the blood cause excessive urination and dehydration, and damage tissues of the body. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. This means it begins when the body's immune system attacks cells in the body. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system destroys insulin-producing cells (beta cells) in the pancreas. Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease. It is diagnosed most commonly between ages 10 and 16. Type 1 diabetes equally affects males and females.", 'created_at': '2011-03-29T23:00:26.000Z', 'updated_at': '2020-10-07T20:06:04.000Z', 'delta': True, 'review_date': None, 'super_condition_id': 5796, 'omim_records': [], 'exported': True, 'info_source': 'This text was researched, composed and written by the MarkerDB curation team.

It is usually an autosomal dominant disorder. It is caused by mutations in the arginine vasopressin (AVP)-neurophysin II preprohormone leading to aberrant preprohormone processing and gradual destruction of AVP-secreting cells. As an autosomal dominant disorder, it means just one copy of the mutated AVP gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Patients typically present between 1 and 6 years of age with polyuria (frequent urination) and polydipsia (excessive thirst). Children with neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus can quickly become dehydrated if they do not drink enough water. Dehydration can lead to constipation and dry skin. If the disorder is not treated, more serious complications of dehydration can occur. These include confusion, low blood pressure, seizures, and coma.

Symptoms often include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased appetite. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, damage to the nerves, damage to the eyes and cognitive impairment. There are three main types of diabetes mellitus: Type 1 diabetes results from the pancreas's failure to produce enough insulin due to loss of beta cells. The loss of beta cells is caused by an autoimmune response. Type 2 diabetes begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin properly. The most common cause is a combination of excessive body weight and insufficient exercise. Gestational diabetes is the third main form, and occurs among pregnant women. As of 2019, an estimated 463 million people had diabetes worldwide (8.8% of the adult population), with type 2 diabetes making up about 90% of the cases.

Risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes include being overweight or obese, leading a sedentary lifestyle, a family history of diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), and low levels of the "good" cholesterol (HDL) and elevated levels of triglycerides in the blood. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes include increased thirst, frequent urination, increased hunger, unintended weight loss and fatigue.
